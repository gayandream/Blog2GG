**About me**: 

Hi there. I’m Gayan Gunaratne. I'm glad you are here to check on my blog.


I’m an environmental modeller and I spend my time working towards improving current approaches to reduce the human footprint on our precious environment using numerical tools.

Originally from Sri Lanka, I moved to Perth Australia in 2011 and graduated from my PhD in Hydrology at The University of Western Australia in December 2015, during which time I was advised primarily by Prof Matt Hipsey and Prof Ryan Vogwill.

I have completed a number of projects over the past one and half decades in Japan, Sri Lanka and Australia in wetland restoration incorporating water quality, ecohydrology and hydrodynamics.
