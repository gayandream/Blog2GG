**About me**: 

I’m Gayan Gunaratne. 

I’m an environmental modeller and I specialise in environmental engineering and assessment of coastal and freshwater systems.
I have been involved in diverse projects related to water resources, river catchments and aquatic environments, including environmental impact assessments, risk studies, engineering inputs, water quality, hydrology, hydrodynamics, effluent reuse
schemes and drainage spills. 

Over the past 15 years, I have contributed to environmental impact and engineering studies for numerous projects in government, industry and research group settings in Japan, Sri Lanka and Australia.

Originally from Sri Lanka, I moved to Perth Australia in 2011 and graduated from my PhD in Hydrology at The University of Western Australia in 2015.
